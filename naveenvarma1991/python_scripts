# I just neeed an output to read a java file and find the class name with it. it was successfully showing the class name when we are changing the class name on runtime also. but the problem is  
 # when i reading a new file i need to adjust its string length on line 10 watch carefully. so i tried a lot but imnot getting the exact result.
  # so please revise this.
    # from line 34 it was displaying the count variable.(for ex. i declared a variable "String name".it shows the number of variables count.
     #please give me  suggestion for the below code.
